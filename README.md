A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is build on the basis of given ui. Here I used svg code for generating the medias. 
Provider is used for state management.
By Default DashBoardScreen() will appear after third  intro page as the landing page. Here I extracted data from the given api. In ever ListTitle the title is extracted from the given api.
If you want to checkout the landing page on basis of design you can change it by calling DashBoardUIScreen() intead of DashBoardScreen() from third_screen.dart file.
